# Bash_Script
These scripts are intended only for the exclusive use of training and experimentation. The author is not responsible in any case for its use.
The scripts collected here in this container are a collection of various scripts written by others, more experienced than me, which I have adjusted in my own way and which I found very useful as they are still a beginner. I thank github and his community for the valuable contribution to my professional growth.
